`pequena` is the first release of the lightastic set of boards. Its a small board based on a ESP8266 or ESP32.

It has 4 outputs and is configured via solder-jumpers at the bottom. The outputs are generic, and can be used to control 4 single output LED strips, like a WS2811/2b, or 2 xxxxxxx...

It uses a 74HCT125 chip to level-shift the ESP's 3.3V output into a 5V TTL output required by the LED strips.

It is an easy and fun DIY board, that uses a mix of through-hole components (chip) and large footprint SMD, and henceforth is super easy to solder, even for beginners.
