**Lightastic** is a set of projects I put together as a hobby.

I have always had a passion about electronics. Unfortunately, with all life tasks, I was never able to fully dedicate myself to it. Then... came the pandemic! I guess, like many, a little bit more time suddenly became available. This is where I decided to put it back to practice and join it together with another passion of mine: Holiday Lighting!

This site consolidates my learnings and experiments with holiday lighting, including electronics, PCB design & assembly, soldering, microcontroler coding, sequencing, and much more! Everything is open source.

This is basically how Lightastic came to be!
